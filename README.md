# MealMingle App

I created a dynamic Flutter-based meals app that offers an array of functionalities. 
Users can seamlessly apply filters to categorize meals according to preferences. 
The option to mark meals as favorites adds a personal touch. 
The app distinguishes itself through its engaging animations, enhancing the overall user experience. 
This project showcases my proficiency in Flutter's development environment, UI design, state management, and animation integration. 
The combination of practical features and visual appeal makes this meals app an example of how Flutter can create user-friendly and visually delightful applications.

#Note to people wanting to use the app

If you want to modify and use the app you can change the meals in the dummy_data.dart file and it should render the app with your data.
